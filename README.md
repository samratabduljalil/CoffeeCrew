# CpffeeCrew - Hand Recognition and Coffee Assistant App

This app is currently under development. It recognizes when someone raises their hand using a bounding box. After a short time, it generates an image where all raised hands are merged. This image helps the office assistant identify who needs coffee.

Stay tuned for updates as development progresses!
